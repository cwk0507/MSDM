    "2. Similar to `range()`, define a custom function `arange()` that can also accept floating point numbers with optional arguments (start, stop, step) and return a list that contains a sequence of numbers from start (inclusive) to stop (exclusive) by step. Do not use `numpy.arange()` for practicing. The function can automatically change the default step from 1 to -1 when implied. The user will repeatedly input the function to evaluate (quit upon error). Your output should look like this:\n",
